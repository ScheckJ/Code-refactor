# Code-refactor

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to rename semantic elements in an html file we were given. We were also required to consolidate css sections in order to create shorter, more efficient code. This assignment provided an example of how code can be written multiple ways to achieve the same goal, but can also be written in an efficient manner.
